<h1> Cyclones, Hurricanes and Typhoons</h1>
<h3><i><b>Cyclones</b></i></h3>
<p><i>Cyclones are tropical storms with winds blowing in a large spiral around the center which is known as the eye which is like a calm zone. Cyclone Jasper's maximum wind speed was 220 km an hour. A cyclone is usually formed in areas with low pressure which draws in nearby winds as the Earth rotates in creates forces the cause the winds to swirl around the low pressure which helps the cyclone to start to spin.</i> </p>

<h3><i><b>Hurricanes</b></i></h3>
<p><i>Hurricanes are a rapidly rotating storm system formed by low pressure points with strong winds. For example: Hurricane Patricia is the fastest hurricane ever recorded with winds hitting top speeds of 345 km an hour. Hurricanes are a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that can produce heavy rain. Warm ocean waters and thunderstorms fuel power-hungry hurricanes. Hurricanes form over the ocean, often beginning as a tropical waveâ€”a low pressure area that moves through the moisture-rich tropics, possibly enhancing shower and thunderstorm activity.</i> </p>

<h3><i><b>Typhoons</b></i></h3>
<p><i>Typhoons are formed when wind blows into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. The wind collects the moisture and starts to rise while the colder air moves below which causes pressure which causes the winds to move very quickly. The winds rotate or spin around the center known as the eye. Typhoons are cyclones that originate over warm tropical oceans. The most powerful Typhoon was Typhoon Haiyan. Typhoons can also sometimes make fish rain from the sky since the Typhoons can catch fish from the ocean.</i> </p>
