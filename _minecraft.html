        <h4>Daring Dungeons Update</h4>
        <p><i>
          In this update Mojang added a brand new item that the mincraft community has gone wild about: The Mace. This is by far the most overpowered weapon mojang has added thus far as it has a base of 7 HP or 3 and a half hearts however every fallen block from two blocks up will do an additional 1.5 hearts of damage and you can literally one shot the warden if u fall from high enough.
          The Mace also cancels out all your fall damage when you are falling and hit a mob and when you are falling from more than five blocks then it issues a large knockback radius.
          The Mace can have these enchantments: Mending, Unbreaking, Smite, Bane of Arthopods, Fire Aspect as well as 3 new enchantments unique to the Mace.
          Density: This enchantment has five levels and with each level adding more damage when falling towards a target each block fallen which is usually 1.5 hearts now does 2 hearts as it adds 0.5 hearts every level.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Therfore if you have Density 5 you could total up to 5 hearts of damage per block fallen. It can be found by enchanting using an enchanting table or spawn in loot chests in structures with enchanted books in their loot table or from the ominous vault.
          Breach: This enchantment has 4 levels and each level reduces 15% of an armors effetiveness of the target. It can be found by enchanting using an enchanting table or spawn in loot chests in structures with enchanted books in their loot table.
          Windburst: This enchantment has 3 levels and each level created particles and sends the opponent higher up into the sky. This enchantment can literally take your opponent with you on a flight to the stars. It is only found by getting it from ominous vaults.
          Other than the mace minecraft also added a new structure called trial chambers which you can choose to be harder by drinking an ominous potion which when drinken all spawners become ominous spawners and you will get the ominous event effect which increases the difficulty and causes the affected spawners to have a 30% chance to drop ominous keys which can be used to open ominous vaults.
          The Mace is crafted by a breeze rod which is dropped by a new mob called the breeze and a heavy core which can be found in ominous vaults but only have 1.2% of being in the new ominous vaults.

        <h4>The Trails and Tales Update</h4>
        <p><i>
          In this update Mojang added a item called a brush which is used to brush blocks and if you see gravel or sand with a suspicious texture, 
          then use the brush on it and u can get a range of different thing such as pottery sherds. Armor Trims, 
          there are 16 unique armor trims that you can use with different ingots to get different colors and each armor trim has a unique pattern that you can add to your armor. Not elytras though. 
          You can duplicate trims by using seven diamonds and a unique block depending which armor trim you have. The Sniffer is a mob that you can hatch from eggs that u can find in the ocean structure other than the ocean monument and the shipwreck 
          or the abandoned Nether Portal. The egg hatches quicker on moss. The sniffer can sniff out ancient seed such as the pitchflower seed or the torchflower seed. The Camel is a new mob that two people can ride on if the camel has a saddle as well as being able to dash up to 12 blocks. 
          Hostile mobs cannot damage u with the exception of the warden, wither, enderdragon, guardians and elder guardians.

        <h4>The Wild Update</h4>
        <p><i>The Wild update introduces new mobs and items. The Warden: a creature with more strength and power than the wither and ender dragon. 
          The warden is blind mob which has 500 health points and 45 points of damage which can almost one shot anything can one shot you with diamond or netherite gear. 
          The only way you can survive one shot is to have netherite or diamond gear enchanted with protection 2 to make it a 2 shot K.O. The Allay is a friendly mob that is found in cages near the woodland mansion. 
          it's practically invincible to anythingâ€™s attack when it is holding an item or a block. 
          The Frog is a new mob that can prettyxwuch eat anything, but if it eats a magma cube it will drop a frog light which is basically a coloured sea lantern. Meanwhile a tadpole is a new mob that comes out from frog eggs and after some time it will become a frog. 
          It looks like a thing with eyes with eyes and a tail and a frog changes colour depending on what biome it is in. Sculk blocks are the Sculk block,
           4the Sculk sensor, the Sculk Catalyst and the Sculk shrieker. 
           The Sculk block is naturally generated near ancient cities and in ancient cities. 
           The Sculk Catalyst creates more Sculk blocks and Sculk veins when a mob or player dies from a 8-block radius it will spread sculk towards where you or the mob died. 
           The Sculk sensor detects the sound waves you send when you're walking, mining and placing a block with the exception of wool and Carpets. 
           The Mangrove Swamp is a new biome that frogs naturally spawn in and where the frogs breed. 
           The most common frog light is the pearlescent frog light but there are also green and orange frog lights. 
           The Allay may be invincible to your attacks and other mobs attacks but it is not immune to lava or water.
