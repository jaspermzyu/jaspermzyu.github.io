          <p>The Trails and Tales update introduced new mechanics and items as well as mobs.</p>
          <p><i>
            In this update Mojang added a item called a brush which is used to brush blocks and if you see gravel or sand with a suspicious texture, 
            then use the brush on it and u can get a range of different thing such as pottery sherds. Armor Trims, 
            there are 16 unique armor trims that you can use with different ingots to get different colors and each armor trim has a unique pattern that you can add to your armor. Not elytras though. 
            You can duplicate trims by using seven diamonds and a unique block depending which armor trim you have. The Sniffer is a mob that you can hatch from eggs that u can find in the ocean structure other than the ocean monument and the shipwreck 
            or the abandoned Nether Portal. The egg hatches quicker on moss. The sniffer can sniff out ancient seed such as the pitchflower seed or the torchflower seed. The Camel is a new mob that two people can ride on if the camel has a saddle as well as being able to dash up to 12 blocks. 
            Hostile mobs cannot damage u with the exception of the warden, wither, enderdragon, guardians and elder guardians.

          <p><i>The Wild update introduces new mobs and items. The Warden: a creature with more strength and power than the wither and ender dragon. 
            The warden is blind mob which has 500 health points and 45 points of damage which can almost one shot anything can one shot you with diamond or netherite gear. 
            The only way you can survive one shot is to have netherite or diamond gear enchanted with protection 2 to make it a 2 shot K.O. The Allay is a friendly mob that is found in cages near the woodland mansion. 
            it's practically invincible to anythingâ€™s attack when it is holding an item or a block. 
            The Frog is a new mob that can prettyxwuch eat anything, but if it eats a magma cube it will drop a frog light which is basically a coloured sea lantern. Meanwhile a tadpole is a new mob that comes out from frog eggs and after some time it will become a frog. 
            It looks like a thing with eyes with eyes and a tail and a frog changes colour depending on what biome it is in. Sculk blocks are the Sculk block,
             4the Sculk sensor, the Sculk Catalyst and the Sculk shrieker. 
             The Sculk block is naturally generated near ancient cities and in ancient cities. 
             The Sculk Catalyst creates more Sculk blocks and Sculk veins when a mob or player dies from a 8-block radius it will spread sculk towards where you or the mob died. 
             The Sculk sensor detects the sound waves you send when you're walking, mining and placing a block with the exception of wool and Carpets. 
             The Mangrove Swamp is a new biome that frogs naturally spawn in and where the frogs breed. 
             The most common frog light is the pearlescent frog light but there are also green and orange frog lights. 
             The Allay may be invincible to your attacks and other mobs attacks but it is not immune to lava or water.

          <h2><h1> Cyclones, Hurricanes and Typhoons</h1>
            <h3><i><b>Cyclones</b></i></h3>
            <p><i>Cyclones are tropical storms with winds blowing in a large spiral around the center which is known as the eye which is like a calm zone. Cyclone Jasper's maximum wind speed was 220 km an hour. A cyclone is usually formed in areas with low pressure which draws in nearby winds as the Earth rotates in creates forces the cause the winds to swirl around the low pressure which helps the cyclone to start to spin.</i> </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><i><b>Hurricanes</b></i></h3>
            <p><i>Hurricanes are a rapidly rotating storm system formed by low pressure points with strong winds. For example: Hurricane Patricia is the fastest hurricane ever recorded with winds hitting top speeds of 345 km an hour. Hurricanes are a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that can produce heavy rain. Warm ocean waters and thunderstorms fuel power-hungry hurricanes. Hurricanes form over the ocean, often beginning as a tropical waveâ€”a low pressure area that moves through the moisture-rich tropics, possibly enhancing shower and thunderstorm activity.</i> </p>
            <hr>
            <h3><i><b>Typhoons</b></i></h3>
            <p><i>Typhoons are formed when wind blows into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. The wind collects the moisture and starts to rise while the colder air moves below which causes pressure which causes the winds to move very quickly. The winds rotate or spin around the center known as the eye. Typhoons are cyclones that originate over warm tropical oceans. The most powerful Typhoon was Typhoon Haiyan. Typhoons can also sometimes make fish rain from the sky since the Typhoons can catch fish from the ocean.</i> </p>

          <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
          <p><i>Earthquakes are catastrophic events that happen when two tectonic plates collide resulting in the earth to crack. 
            Earthquake usually happen in Japan because Japan is between 4 tectonic plates and when one collides to another it causes an earth either in Japan or in the water near Japan resulting in a tsunami. 
            The most powerful Earthquake: The Indian Ocean Earthquake in 2004 resulted in a devastating 277,898 deaths. Japan has developed houses that have a lighter roof as well as having the ability to sway around when there is an earthquake so that the main building doesn't collapse. 
            Over 80% of large earthquakes occcur aroudnt the edges of the Pacific ocean, an area slo known as the<b> "Ring Of Fire"</b>. The Ring of fire is full of volcanoes that when one volcano erupts slowly every single volcano in the Ring of fire would erupt as well as creating absolutely devastating earthquakes. 
            The Ring of fire has existed for more than 35 million years. The Ring of fire has minor and major eruptions occuring about every 50 years.</i></p>

          <h2>Bushfires</h2>
          <p><i>Bushfires are natural fires that spark up and can help plants reproduce since some plants have adapted to use fire as part of their survival for example: The bottlebrush plant has adapted so that when there is a bushfire it the burn the outer layer of the plants head and it releases the seeds stored inside the plant which grows into more bottlebrush plant and the cycle continues. Bushfires can also help the areas that are burned because it kills insects and diseases that could be harming the trees in the area. The fire can also make room for new shoots to grow as well as new habitats for the wildlife. However bushfires can still be dangerous because if a bushfire sparks near a community the people living in the community will be forced to evacuate and if there is a farm in the area it would kill the livestock in the farm as well as destroying crops. For example: The Black Saturday Fires was the worst bushfire in Australiaâ€™s modern history. It happened at the 7th of February 2009 in Victoria and it killed 173 people and injured 414 and demolished ove 3,500 buildings including 2,029 houses and 7,562 people were forced to evacuate. People who protect areas can do a controlled burn since it can help the plants. A controlled burn is done by removing possible fuel from the area so that the fire wouldnâ€™t get absolutely massive.</i></p>

          <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
          <p><i>Volcanoes are formed when one tectonic moves under another tectonic plate.
            Usually a thin, heavy oceanic plate subducts or moves under a thick contintental plate.
            Volcanoes have a place under the earths crust called a magma chamber which is where the magma is kept.
            The place where the magma can come out of is called a vent.
            Volcanoes can erupt since magma is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in the magma chambers.
            Eventually some of the magma pushes through vents and fissure to the surface.
            When magma reaches the surface it is called lava instead of magma.
            The possibly most famous volcanic eruption was the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1944.
            It when pompeii fell to the volcanic ash and lava of the humongous stratovolcano.
            This eruption killed about 16,000 people in total but it only killed 2,000 people in pompeii.
            The largest volcano we know of is on Mars called Olympus Mons. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano which means it eruptions aren't very deadly.
            Mars used to have thousands of supervolcanoes(The most deadly type of volcanoes) but the supervolcanoes were so powerful that they blew themselves up.

          <h2>Greek and Roman Mythology</h2>
          <p>
            Greek and Roman Mythology are very simillar since Roman mythology is an Roman adapted version of Greek Mythology.
            In the beginning there were the original 11 protogenoi:Chaos, Gaia, Tartarus, Hemera, Chronos, Nyx, Erebus, Aether, Ananke, Eros, Pontus and Ourea.
            The first race after the protogenoi(Primordial Gods) were the 12 main Titans children of Ouranous and Gaia.
          </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Kronos(Saturn), the titan king and the titan of time(not to be confused with chronos the god of time</li>
              <li> Iapetus, the titan of Mortality</li>
              <li> Hyperion, the titan of heavenly light and watchfulness</li>
              <li> Rhea, the wife of Kronos and the titaness of female fertility, motherhood and generation</li>
              <li> Koios, titan of the inquisitive mind</li>
              <li> Crius, titan of constellations</li>
              <li> Thea, titaness of sigh, prophecy and all things that shimmer, Wife of Hyperion</li>
              <li> Themis, titaness of divine law and order, prophetic god over the ancient orcales including Delphi</li>
              <li> Mnemosyne, titaness of memory and rememberance and the inventress of language and words</li>
              <li> Phoebe, titaness of intelluct and prophecy</li>
              <li> Tethys, titaness of freshwater</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            When Ournous threw down their children Gaia convinced the titans to kill Ouranous and from the limbs of Ouranous emerged Aphrodite the goddes of love and beauty.
            Then the titans had children who were the Gods. There are over a hundred gods so heres a short list of the gods:

            <p>The Three Fates are divine beings that preside over the fates of every god, giant, titan and mortal. The three fates and their jobs are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Clotho weaved the Threads of Fate, the beginning of all life.</li>
              <li>Lahkesis would measeure the threads, determining how long a mortal, God, giants and Titans life span would be.</li>
              <li>Atropos cuts the threads, ending the life</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Gaia was furious when the titans were defeated by the gods led by Zeus, so Gaia had more children called the giants.
              Each giant was designed to have an opposing god. Here is a list of the giants:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Alcyloneus - Bane of Hades</li>
