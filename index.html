          <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
          <p><i>Earthquakes are catastrophic events that happen when two tectonic plates collide resulting in the earth to crack. 
            Earthquake usually happen in Japan because Japan is between 4 tectonic plates and when one collides to another it causes an earth either in Japan or in the water near Japan resulting in a tsunami. 
            The most powerful Earthquake: The Indian Ocean Earthquake in 2004 resulted in a devastating 277,898 deaths. Japan has developed houses that have a lighter roof as well as having the ability to sway around when there is an earthquake so that the main building doesn't collapse. 
            Over 80% of large earthquakes occcur aroudnt the edges of the Pacific ocean, an area slo known as the<b> "Ring Of Fire"</b>. The Ring of fire is full of volcanoes that when one volcano erupts slowly every single volcano in the Ring of fire would erupt as well as creating absolutely devastating earthquakes. 
            The Ring of fire has existed for more than 35 million years. The Ring of fire has minor and major eruptions occuring about every 50 years.</i></p>

          <h2>Bushfires</h2>
          <p><i>Bushfires are natural fires that spark up and can help plants reproduce since some plants have adapted to use fire as part of their survival for example: The bottlebrush plant has adapted so that when there is a bushfire it the burn the outer layer of the plants head and it releases the seeds stored inside the plant which grows into more bottlebrush plant and the cycle continues. Bushfires can also help the areas that are burned because it kills insects and diseases that could be harming the trees in the area. The fire can also make room for new shoots to grow as well as new habitats for the wildlife. However bushfires can still be dangerous because if a bushfire sparks near a community the people living in the community will be forced to evacuate and if there is a farm in the area it would kill the livestock in the farm as well as destroying crops. For example: The Black Saturday Fires was the worst bushfire in Australia’s modern history. It happened at the 7th of February 2009 in Victoria and it killed 173 people and injured 414 and demolished ove 3,500 buildings including 2,029 houses and 7,562 people were forced to evacuate. People who protect areas can do a controlled burn since it can help the plants. A controlled burn is done by removing possible fuel from the area so that the fire wouldn’t get absolutely massive.</i></p>

          <h2>Volcanoes</h2>
          <p><i>Volcanoes are formed when one tectonic moves under another tectonic plate.
            Usually a thin, heavy oceanic plate subducts or moves under a thick contintental plate.
            Volcanoes have a place under the earths crust called a magma chamber which is where the magma is kept.
            The place where the magma can come out of is called a vent.
            Volcanoes can erupt since magma is lighter than the solid rock around it, magma rises and collects in the magma chambers.
            Eventually some of the magma pushes through vents and fissure to the surface.
            When magma reaches the surface it is called lava instead of magma.
            The possibly most famous volcanic eruption was the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1944.
            It when pompeii fell to the volcanic ash and lava of the humongous stratovolcano.
            This eruption killed about 16,000 people in total but it only killed 2,000 people in pompeii.
            The largest volcano we know of is on Mars called Olympus Mons. Olympus Mons is a shield volcano which means it eruptions aren't very deadly.
            Mars used to have thousands of supervolcanoes(The most deadly type of volcanoes) but the supervolcanoes were so powerful that they blew themselves up.
