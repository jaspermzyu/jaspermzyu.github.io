        <h2>Python</h2>
        <p>
           You can code many things using python for example: 
           <quote>
               a1 = input("How many planets are in the solar system:" )
               if a1 == 8:
                print("Congratulations you're correct!")
               else:
                print("Incorrect, the answer was 8")
           </quote>
           As a result if you type anything other than 8 you would get the message 'Incorrect the answer was 8', but if you do type 8 then you would get the message 'Congratulations, you're correct!'.
           
        </p>
