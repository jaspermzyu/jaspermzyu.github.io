        <p><i>Bushfires are natural fires that spark up and can help plants reproduce since some plants have adapted to use fire as part of their survival for example: The bottlebrush plant has adapted so that when there is a bushfire it the burn the outer layer of the plants head and it releases the seeds stored inside the plant which grows into more bottlebrush plant and the cycle continues. Bushfires can also help the areas that are burned because it kills insects and diseases that could be harming the trees in the area. The fire can also make room for new shoots to grow as well as new habitats for the wildlife. However bushfires can still be dangerous because if a bushfire sparks near a community the people living in the community will be forced to evacuate and if there is a farm in the area it would kill the livestock in the farm as well as destroying crops. For example: The Black Saturday Fires was the worst bushfire in Australia’s modern history. It happened at the 7th of February 2009 in Victoria and it killed 173 people and injured 414 and demolished ove 3,500 buildings including 2,029 houses and 7,562 people were forced to evacuate. People who protect areas can do a controlled burn since it can help the plants. A controlled burn is done by removing possible fuel from the area so that the fire wouldn’t get absolutely massive.</i></p>
