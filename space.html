        <hr>
        <p> <i><a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/universe/what-are-black-holes/">Black Holes </a> are objects in space that warp spacetime as well as being able to have such a strong gravitational field that even <b>light</b> cannot escape it's grasp. The black hole could also possibly be an <b>Einstein-Rosen Bridge</b> which is another name for a wormhole which could possibly be a portal between universes or two different places.</i></p>
